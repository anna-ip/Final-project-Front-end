# Sustain a React Native App

Sustain is an app that makes cooking vegetarian dinners easier, and fun for the whole family. The core focuses of this app is to teaching families about making sustainable food choices . The user starts by choosing a vegetable icon all vegetables are grown in Sweden, then based on vegetable selection recipes are generated from an external Api called [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api "Spoonacular") . Users then can scroll recipe highlights and choice one that suits their dinner needs. Once recipe is chosen users will be able to see suitability information for now it its seasonal availability and the co2 foot print we created a backend with mongodb. Scrolling further down the page users see the recipes and other useful information.
